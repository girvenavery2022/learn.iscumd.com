# Wiring

This page is a simple walkthrough of all the basics for wiring. Most of the useful things related to wires and how to use them will be outlined here in this document.

## Wire

### 1. Conductors

These are materials which are used to transfer a signal. In wiring, copper is used for the vast majority of analog and digital wires. There's a whole bunch of different conductor coatings which may be used which change the material properties. This is not significant for the purposes of understanding what a wire does. In some high speed digital applications, like maybe ethernet, light is sometimes used instead of electricity. These cables don't use copper, but something like glass nano-tubes which transfer light pretty well. Aluminum can sometimes be found as the conductor for wires. In the 60's and 70's aluminum was used in wires due to copper shortage. Generally, it's a bad idea to mix and match aluminum with copper though, because the connections heat up due to galvanic corrosion.

In wiring, the conductor used in the wire will typically be of two categories. Either stranded or solid core wire. A solid core wire is, as it says in the name, fully solid conductor. Solid core wires are typically a lot stiffer, and you potentially run the risk of snapping the conductor inside the wire if its used in an environment where the wire is being bent a lot. A stranded wire has its core made up of many thin hairs of conductor. These are really nice, because they bend easily. Although, cheap wire will have very few strands. Having many strands and having quick a bit of conductor inside your wire is good.

### 2. Gauge

Wire guage is a measurement of wire diameter. Wire gauge is typically referred to in either American wire gauge (AWG) or IEC 60228 (mm^2). Wire guage determines how much electrical current a wire can carry. Higher wire guage means thinner wire, because that makes perfect sense. It makes so much sense there is a scale for very thick wires called the "aught" scale. Which are wires of guage 0. A wire that is 3 aught is typically written "000" or "3/0."

### 3. Insulation

Wires typically come with a insulation or jacket protecting the conductor. This insulation is typically made from plastics or rubbers. Theres many different types of insulation, but we only care about the plastics because they bend, are inert, and are mostly non-conductive. The most common types of wire insulation that you'd see are PVC and Silicone. PVC insulated wires are typically hard and more difficult to bend; however, they have a huge applicable temperature range as well as being flame, moisture, and abrasion resistant. Silicone wire is very bendable and soft. The author's preferance is silicone. It is extremely flexible and very highly temperature resistant. Silicone can wear easily though. There's some pretty wacky material science being done to make plastics that have even higher temperature ratings, are significantly stronger, all while being flexible. You can Google yourself into a hole if you'd like.

### 4. Shielding

Wires can also come with shielding between the conductor and the wire insulation. Typically a shielded wire will have insulation or dialectric around its conductor, then a shielding layer, then an insulation outer layer. The shielding layer is often aluminum or copper foil, but sometimes it can look like a metalic braid. Shielding is used to protect signals against outside electrical interference, or to protect the outside from the conductor emitting strange vibes. In very thick high voltage power cables, shielding is typically required to prevent random and spontaneous electrostatic discharge from the wire. The shielding is attached to the connectors ground in both cases so that the extra currents can be sinked.

### 5. Conduit

Wires can be run through protective housings called conduit. This isn't really so necessary, but it is a really nice touch. Having wire just lying out and about doesn't look very professional. It is necessary in cases where the wire could potentially be damaged, or is going to be bending and moving around a lot. Conduit can also aid in long cable runs, because you can fish more wires through a conduit by tying them to the end of a wire and pulling new ones through without having to dig out the conduit.
